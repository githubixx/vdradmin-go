# vdradmin-go

Modern rewrite of [vdradmin-am](http://andreas.vdr-developer.org/vdradmin-am/index.html) in Go with hexagonal architecture, clean code practices, and modern web technologies. **Currently this is only a prove of concept and it will eat your computer!** ;-)

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This code can't even be considered an ALPHA Version! **If you run it and it destroys your computer, deletes your videos or something like that, it's YOUR problem!** ;-) **Test it only** with a test [VDR](https://tvdr.de/) instance!

This code was mainly generated with Claude Code. I just wanted to see how far I can get converting the quite dated code base of [vdradmin-am](http://andreas.vdr-developer.org/vdradmin-am/index.html) to Go and more recent technologies.

For now the code compiles and it displays something. That's it! **DO NOT expect to get something close to vdradmin-am!!!**

## Goals

- **Modern Architecture**: Hexagonal (ports & adapters) architecture for maintainability
- **Clean Code**: Following Go best practices and SOLID principles
- **Modern UI**: [htmx](https://htmx.org/) for dynamic interactions, modern CSS, minimal JavaScript
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with comprehensive error handling
- **Performance**: Concurrent operations, efficient caching
- **Security**: Secure authentication, input validation, HTTPS support
- **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, tracing ready
